# Product Requirements Document: TAIFA-FIALA Platform Refactoring

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the comprehensive plan for refactoring the TAIFA-FIALA platform from a funding tracker to an innovation archive. The document serves as a guide for developers, stakeholders, and AI assistance in implementing the strategic restructuring plan.

### 1.2 Product Vision

Transform TAIFA-FIALA from a passive funding announcement aggregator to an active innovation-driven research platform that documents African AI excellence, creating a unified space where funders showcase impact, innovators gain recognition, and researchers access rigorous evidence.
