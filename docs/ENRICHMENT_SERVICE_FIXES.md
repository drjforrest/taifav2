# TAIFA-FIALA Enrichment Service - Issues Fixed

## Summary

The enrichment service was not working due to several missing components and configuration issues. Here's what was fixed:

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Database Connection Module
**Problem**: The `snowball_sampler.py` was importing `database.connection` which didn't exist.

**Fix**: 
- Updated imports to use `config.database.get_supabase()`
- Modified database queries to use Supabase client syntax
- Fixed table operations from raw SQL to Supabase API calls

### 2. Missing Helper Functions in Perplexity AI Module
**Problem**: The `perplexity_african_ai.py` had placeholder functions that weren't implemented.

**Fix**: Added complete implementations for:
- `_extract_structured_findings()`
- `_generate_summary()`
- `_extract_key_findings()`
- `_extract_innovations()`
- `_extract_funding_updates()`
- `_extract_policy_developments()`
- `_extract_sources()`
- `_extract_innovation_entities()`
- `_extract_funding_entities()`
- `_extract_research_entities()`
- `_calculate_confidence_score()`
- `_extract_emerging_themes()`

### 3. Enrichment Scheduler Not Auto-Starting
**Problem**: The enrichment scheduler was created but not initialized during application startup.

**Fix**: 
- Added scheduler initialization to `main.py` startup event
- Added proper cleanup on shutdown
- Scheduler now starts automatically when the API starts

### 4. Missing Error Handling and Logging
**Fix**: Improved error handling throughout all modules with comprehensive logging.

## Files Modified

1. **`backend/services/snowball_sampler.py`**
   - Fixed database imports and operations
   - Updated to use Supabase client

2. **`backend/etl/intelligence/perplexity_african_ai.py`**
   - Added missing helper functions
   - Improved structured data extraction
   - Added confidence scoring
   - Enhanced pattern recognition

3. **`backend/main.py`**
   - Added enrichment scheduler initialization on startup
   - Added scheduler cleanup on shutdown

## How to Test the Enrichment Service

### 1. Run the Test Script
```bash
cd backend
python test_enrichment_service.py
```

This will check:
- Environment variables
- Database connection
- Enrichment scheduler
- Perplexity AI module (if API key provided)
- Vector service
- Unified cache
- Snowball sampler

### 2. Required Environment Variables
```bash
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your_perplexity_api_key_here"
# Other required variables should already be in your .env file
```

### 3. Start the Main Application
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

The enrichment scheduler will now start automatically and log its status.

## API Endpoints for Enrichment

### Scheduler Management
- `GET /api/etl/scheduler/status` - Check scheduler status
- `POST /api/etl/scheduler/configure` - Configure scheduler settings
- `POST /api/etl/scheduler/start` - Start scheduler manually
- `POST /api/etl/scheduler/stop` - Stop scheduler

### Manual Enrichment
- `POST /api/etl/enrichment` - Trigger manual enrichment job
- `GET /api/etl/enrichment/status/{job_id}` - Check enrichment job status

### Monitoring
- `GET /api/etl/status` - Overall ETL system status
- `GET /api/etl/jobs` - List all ETL jobs
- `GET /api/vector/stats` - Vector database statistics

## Expected Behavior

1. **Automatic Scheduler**: Runs every 6 hours by default
2. **Intelligence Reports**: Generated and stored in both vector DB and Supabase
3. **Snowball Sampling**: Automatically runs after enrichment to discover new citations
4. **Caching**: API responses are cached to avoid rate limits
5. **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with retries

## Configuration Options

The scheduler can be configured with:
- `interval_hours`: How often to run (default: 6 hours)
- `intelligence_types`: Types of intelligence to gather (default: innovation_discovery, funding_landscape)
- `geographic_focus`: Countries to focus on (default: Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Egypt)
- `provider`: AI provider to use (currently only "perplexity" supported)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No API Key**: Set `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` environment variable
2. **Database Connection**: Ensure Supabase credentials are correct
3. **Scheduler Not Running**: Check logs for startup errors
4. **Rate Limits**: The system has built-in caching and rate limiting

### Log Locations
Check application logs for detailed information about:
- Scheduler status and runs
- AI API calls and responses
- Database operations
- Cache performance

## Next Steps

1. Run the test script to verify everything is working
2. Start the main application
3. Monitor the logs for scheduler activity
4. Use the API endpoints to check status and trigger manual runs
5. Set up monitoring dashboards using the provided endpoints

The enrichment service should now be fully functional and automatically running in the background!
