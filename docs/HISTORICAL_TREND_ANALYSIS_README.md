# Historical Trend Analysis - Innovation Lifecycle Tracker

This document describes the implementation of the Innovation Lifecycle Tracker component as part of Phase 2 of the Citations Expansion Strategy.

## Overview

The Innovation Lifecycle Tracker service enables tracking of innovations from research paper to market deployment. It provides:

- Temporal tracking of innovation stages (research → prototype → pilot → production → scaling)
- Time-to-market analysis for different domains and regions
- Success/failure pattern identification based on lifecycle characteristics
- Integration with existing citation analysis for knowledge flow mapping

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The implementation adds the following tables to the database:

1. `innovation_lifecycles` - Tracks each stage of an innovation's lifecycle
2. `domain_evolution` - Maps how AI application areas mature over time
3. `success_patterns` - Identifies common characteristics of breakthrough innovations
4. `failure_patterns` - Analyzes patterns in stalled or abandoned projects

### Service Layer

The `InnovationLifecycleTracker` service (`backend/services/innovation_lifecycle_tracker.py`) provides methods for:

- Creating and updating lifecycle stage records
- Retrieving complete lifecycle information for innovations
- Calculating lifecycle metrics including time-to-market
- Generating analytics on lifecycle patterns across the platform
- Integrating with publications and existing innovation data

### API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available under `/api/trends`:

- `GET /api/trends/lifecycles` - Get lifecycle records with optional filtering
- `GET /api/trends/lifecycles/{innovation_id}` - Get complete lifecycle for a specific innovation
- `POST /api/trends/lifecycles` - Create a new lifecycle stage record
- `PUT /api/trends/lifecycles/{record_id}` - Update an existing lifecycle stage record
- `DELETE /api/trends/lifecycles/{record_id}` - Delete a lifecycle stage record
- `GET /api/trends/time-to-market` - Get time-to-market analysis across innovations
- `POST /api/trends/link-publication` - Link a publication to an innovation's lifecycle

## Integration Points

The Innovation Lifecycle Tracker integrates with:

1. **Citations Analysis Service** - Uses existing citation networks to trace knowledge flow from research to innovation
2. **Enhanced Publication Service** - Utilizes development stage detection for lifecycle tracking

## Usage Examples

### Tracking an Innovation Lifecycle

```python
from services.innovation_lifecycle_tracker import innovation_lifecycle_tracker, LifecycleStage
from datetime import date

# Create lifecycle records for each stage
await innovation_lifecycle_tracker.create_lifecycle_record(
    innovation_id=some_innovation_id,
    stage=LifecycleStage.RESEARCH,
    start_date=date(2023, 1, 1),
    end_date=date(2023, 6, 1),
    key_milestones=["Research paper published", "Grant awarded"],
    resources_invested={"funding": 50000, "personnel": 2}
)

await innovation_lifecycle_tracker.create_lifecycle_record(
    innovation_id=some_innovation_id,
    stage=LifecycleStage.PROTOTYPE,
    start_date=date(2023, 6, 1),
    end_date=date(2023, 12, 1),
    key_milestones=["MVP developed", "Initial testing completed"]
)
```

### Retrieving Lifecycle Information

```python
# Get complete lifecycle for an innovation
lifecycle_stages = await innovation_lifecycle_tracker.get_innovation_lifecycle(innovation_id)

# Calculate lifecycle metrics
metrics = await innovation_lifecycle_tracker.get_lifecycle_metrics(innovation_id)
print(f"Time to market: {metrics.time_to_market_days} days")
print(f"Current stage: {metrics.current_stage.value}")
```

### Using the API

```bash
# Get lifecycle information for a specific innovation
curl "http://localhost:8030/api/trends/lifecycles/{innovation_id}"

# Get time-to-market analysis
curl "http://localhost:8030/api/trends/time-to-market?country=Kenya"
```

## Testing

A test script is available at `backend/scripts/test_lifecycle_tracker.py` to verify the functionality of the service.

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements include:

- Advanced pattern detection algorithms
- Predictive modeling for success/failure
- Integration with machine learning models for automated stage detection
- Real-time dashboard updates for lifecycle tracking
